# Advanced MongoDB Features

## 1. Text Search and Indexing

### Full-Text Search Capabilities

MongoDB provides text search capabilities using text indexes. This allows you to perform searches across text fields in documents.

- To enable text search, create a text index on the fields you want to search:

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex({ content: "text", title: "text" });
```

- You can then use the $text operator to search the indexed fields:

```javascript
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "mongodb" } });
```

### Text Indexes and Their Use Cases

- Text indexes are case-insensitive and ignore certain stop words (like "the", "a", etc.), making them ideal for search functionalities in applications.
- You can prioritize certain fields using weights when creating a text index, giving more importance to matches in specific fields:

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex({ title: "text", content: "text" }, { weights: { title: 2, content: 1 } });
```

## 2. Geospatial Data

### Storing and Querying Geospatial Data

MongoDB supports geospatial data types, such as points and polygons, enabling you to store and query geographical information.

- Use the GeoJSON format to store locations:

```javascript
db.places.insertOne({
  name: "Central Park",
  location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.97, 40.77] }
});
```

### 2dsphere and 2d Indexes

MongoDB provides 2dsphere indexes for spherical (earth-like) coordinates, allowing for complex geospatial queries.

```javascript
db.places.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" });
```

With this index, you can perform queries like finding places within a certain radius:

```javascript
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.97, 40.77] },
      $maxDistance: 5000 // Within 5km
    }
  }
});
```

## 3. Transactions in MongoDB

### Introduction to Transactions

- MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing you to perform multiple operations across different documents or collections atomically. This ensures all operations either succeed or fail together.
- Transactions are useful for applications requiring strong data consistency, similar to relational databases.

### Using Transactions with ACID Properties

MongoDB transactions adhere to ACID properties:

- Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within the transaction are completed; if one fails, the entire transaction fails.
- Consistency: Ensures the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
- Isolation: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the case of a system crash.

Transactions are initiated using startSession() and withTransaction() in the MongoDB shell or through drivers:

```javascript
const session = client.startSession();
session.withTransaction(() => {
  db.users.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { balance: 100 } }, { session });
  db.transactions.insertOne({ userId: 1, amount: 100 }, { session });
});
session.endSession();
```
