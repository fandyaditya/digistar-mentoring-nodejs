# Schema Design

## Data Modeling Concepts

### Schema Design Patterns: Embedded vs. Referenced

In MongoDB, data can be modeled in two primary ways:

1. **Embedded Documents**: Store related data within the same document. This approach is ideal when related data is often accessed together, as it minimizes the number of database queries.

2. **Referenced Documents**: Store related data in separate documents, linked by a reference. This is useful when related data is large or frequently updated independently.

### Choosing the Right Data Model

Considerations for choosing between embedding and referencing include:

- **Data Access Patterns**: How frequently related data is accessed together.
- **Document Size**: MongoDB documents have a size limit (16MB). Embedding large documents can lead to performance issues.
- **Data Growth**: Referencing is better when you expect rapid growth in related data.

```javascript
// Embedded Document Example
{
  _id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    country: "USA"
  }
}

// Referenced Document Example
// User Document
{
  _id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  addressId: 101
}

// Address Document
{
  _id: 101,
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "Anytown",
  country: "USA"
}
```

When deciding between embedding and referencing, consider the specific requirements of your application, such as read/write patterns, data size, and scalability needs.

## 2. Relationships in MongoDB

### One-to-One Relationship

In a one-to-one relationship, each document in one collection is associated with exactly one document in another collection. This relationship can be represented by either embedding or referencing, depending on the use case.

Example: Storing a user's profile details in a separate collection and referencing it in the main user document.

```javascript
// Embedding Example
{
  _id: 1,
  username: "johndoe",
  profile: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
  }
}

// Referencing Example
{
  _id: 1,
  username: "johndoe",
  profileId: 101 // Reference to profile document
}
```

### One-to-Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship occurs when a single document is associated with multiple documents in another collection. This is commonly implemented using embedding for small, related datasets, or referencing for larger or independently managed datasets.

Example: A blog post and its comments.

```javascript
// Embedding Example
{
  _id: 1,
  title: "My Blog Post",
  comments: [
    { user: "Alice", text: "Great post!" },
    { user: "Bob", text: "Thanks for sharing!" }
  ]
}

// Referencing Example
{
  _id: 1,
  title: "My Blog Post",
  commentIds: [1001, 1002] // References to comment documents
}
```

### Many-to-Many Relationship

In a many-to-many relationship, multiple documents in one collection are related to multiple documents in another collection. This is typically implemented using referencing, sometimes with a junction (or join) collection.

Example: Students and courses where a student can enroll in multiple courses and each course can have multiple students.

```javascript
// Student Document
{
  _id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  courseIds: [101, 102] // References to course documents
}

// Course Document
{
  _id: 101,
  name: "Math 101",
  studentIds: [1, 2] // References to student documents
}
```

## 3. Indexes

### What Are Indexes?

Indexes in MongoDB are special data structures that store a small portion of the collection's data set in an easy-to-traverse form. Indexes improve the speed of queries and sorting operations by reducing the number of documents MongoDB needs to scan.

Without an index, MongoDB performs a collection scan, meaning it examines every document in the collection to find those that match the query.

### Creating and Managing Indexes

Indexes can be created using the `createIndex()` method. MongoDB automatically creates an index on the `_id` field, but additional indexes can be created on other fields.

```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 }); // Creates an ascending index on the age field
```

Indexes can be managed using `dropIndex()` to remove an index or `getIndexes()` to view all indexes on a collection.

### Indexing Strategies for Performance Optimization

- Use compound indexes for queries that involve multiple fields.

```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1, city: 1 }); // Compound index on age and city
```

- Consider unique indexes when you need to enforce uniqueness on a field (e.g., email addresses).

```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

- Partial indexes can be used to index only a subset of documents in a collection, improving performance for specific queries.
