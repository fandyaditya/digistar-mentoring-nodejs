# Aggregation

## 1. Introduction to Aggregation

### Understanding the Aggregation Pipeline

The aggregation framework in MongoDB allows you to process data records and return computed results. The pipeline consists of multiple stages, each performing an operation on the input documents and passing the results to the next stage.

Common stages include `$match` (filtering documents), `$group` (grouping documents by a specified key), `$sort` (sorting documents), and `$project` (reshaping documents).

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "shipped" } }, // Filters for shipped orders
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }, // Groups by customer and sums amounts
  { $sort: { total: -1 } } // Sorts by total in descending order
]);
```

## 2. Common Aggregation Operations

### Using $lookup for Joins

The `$lookup` stage performs a left outer join to connect data from different collections. This is useful for combining related data.

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
]);
```

In this example, orders are joined with customer details based on the customerId field.

### Working with $unwind

The `$unwind` stage deconstructs an array field from the input documents, outputting a document for each element of the array.

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$items" } // Unwinds the items array, creating a document for each item
]);
```

This is useful for processing each element of an array separately.

### Grouping Data with $group

The `$group` stage groups documents by a specified key and can perform aggregate operations like sum, average, min, max, etc.

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$productId", totalSales: { $sum: "$quantity" } } }
]);
```

In this example, sales are grouped by product, and the total quantity sold is calculated.

## 3. Advanced Aggregation Concepts

### Facets and Bucketing

Facets allow you to create multiple sub-pipelines within a single aggregation, enabling complex data analysis in a single query.

```javascript
db.products.aggregate([
  {
    $facet: {
      "priceBuckets": [
        { $bucket: { groupBy: "$price", boundaries: [0, 50, 100, 200], default: "Other" } }
      ],
      "categories": [
        { $group: { _id: "$category", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
      ]
    }
  }
]);
```

Bucketing allows you to categorize documents into different groups based on specified boundaries, such as price ranges.

### Aggregation Performance Considerations

- Consider indexing fields that are frequently used in `$match` stages to optimize performance.
- Use projection to limit the amount of data processed by the pipeline, improving efficiency.
- Limit the number of documents passed between stages, especially in memory-intensive operations like sorting.
